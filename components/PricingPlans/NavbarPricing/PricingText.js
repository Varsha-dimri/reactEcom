                <p>
                    <strong>(Leg-A + Leg-B deduction difference) :</strong> We charge only Leg B, as the call connected to agent and he started speaking with customer.
                </p>

                    <strong>Unlimited Plan :</strong> Our unlimited plan measured based on usage, “We dont restrict the calls by channels in any plan” because call non connection is bigger loss for customer incase of channel restriction.
