                            In today’s fast moving business times, the probability that you are not up-to-date with new technologies is shrinking the growth of your business. Every company, big or small, any industry, needs a constant flow of happy customers and clients. Organizations generate leads through various online & offline marketing initiatives with the aim of converting these leads into customers. Majority of the companies use hardcopy or excel sheets to maintain details of these leads. Any follow-ups done, conversions made or even discarded leads are still managed on paper or time consuming excel sheets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No matter which industry your company belongs to, your pain-areas following the old processes i.e. creating manual reports, no timely & systematic follow ups will cause leakage in business and costly business operations. These methods cause loss of correct information on conversions, loss of time and money
                        </p>
                        <p>You spend money and resources on marketing efforts to generate leads, what happens to it? Well most marketing leads are never pursued. In fact, it’s estimated that 80% of leads generated through marketing get lost, discarded or ignored. That’s a lot of lost revenue.  Also most leads don’t convert on the first impression, which means they need to be nurtured over time.<strong> So Betyphon is solution for you</strong></p>
